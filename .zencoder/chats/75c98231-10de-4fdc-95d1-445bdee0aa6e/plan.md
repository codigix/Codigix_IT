# Spec and build

## Agent Instructions

Ask the user questions when anything is unclear or needs their input. This includes:

- Ambiguous or incomplete requirements
- Technical decisions that affect architecture or user experience
- Trade-offs that require business context

Do not make assumptions on important decisions — get clarification first.

## Workflow Steps

### [x] Step: Technical Specification

Assess the task's difficulty, as underestimating it leads to poor outcomes.

- **easy**: Straightforward implementation, trivial bug fix or feature
- **medium**: Moderate complexity, some edge cases or caveats to consider
- **hard**: Complex logic, many caveats, architectural considerations, or high-risk changes

**Difficulty**: medium

Create a technical specification for the task that is appropriate for the complexity level:

- Review the existing codebase architecture and identify reusable components.
- Define the implementation approach based on established patterns in the project.
- Identify all source code files that will be created or modified.
- Define any necessary data model, API, or interface changes.
- Describe verification steps using the project's test and lint commands.

Save the output to `c:\Users\Admin\Downloads\codigix-IT-services\.zencoder\chats\75c98231-10de-4fdc-95d1-445bdee0aa6e/spec.md` with:

- Technical context (language, dependencies)
- Implementation approach
- Source code structure changes
- Data model / API / interface changes
- Verification approach

### [ ] Step: Implementation

1. **Update Background and Layout**: Change the main container background and add decorative shapes.
2. **Restyle Login Card**: Apply dark theme, transparency, and backdrop blur to the card.
3. **Redesign Form Inputs**: Update email and password input styling to match the dark theme.
4. **Style Action Button**: Transform the "Sign In" button to match the white-background style in the target image.
5. **Adjust Footer and Forgot Password**: Reposition and style the "Forgot password?" link and update/remove the footer.
6. **Final Polish and Responsive Check**: Ensure the design is pixel-perfect and works on mobile.
7. **Verification**: Run the app and verify the UI.
8. **Report**: Write the final report to `report.md`.
